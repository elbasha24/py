# Nested function calls in Python refer to the situation where a function is called within another function. This can occur when a function is defined inside another function and is then invoked within the outer function.
# Here's an example to illustrate nested function calls:

def outer_function():
    print("This is the outer function.")

    def inner_function():
        print("This is the inner function.")

    inner_function()  # Calling the inner function inside the outer function

outer_function()  # Calling the outer function
